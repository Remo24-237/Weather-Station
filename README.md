# IoT- enabled Environmental Monitoring System Implementation â€“ Weather Station

-This repository contains project performed during the fall 2022 semester in the course EEGR390 Principles of design
-The file "AWS_IOT_ds18x20_sensor.py" contains code to pull data from a Rasberry PicoW connected a water    temperature sensor. This data is sent to AWS's IOT platform for collection and processing.
-The file "Weather_station_2_sensors.py" contains code to pull data from a Rasberry Pi 3 connected a water temperature sensor and an air temperature and humidity sensor. This data is sent to  IOT platform called initial state for collection and processing. This file is part of a set of 2 files used to pull data from 4 individual sensors placed at different locations around the Morgan State University campus to monitor climate conditions.
